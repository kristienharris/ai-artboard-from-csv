# Create artboards from spreadsheet (csv)
by Kristien Harris (Inspired by many but thanks to the most important sources below)

## Purpose:
Create named artboards from a csv.

## Notes:
- save spreadsheet as csv (remove empty rows in text editor)
- file needs column headers (name, width and height)
- dimensions in csv must be in mm
- will create artboards in the order found in the csv file
- use the rearrange artboards function to lay them out how you like
